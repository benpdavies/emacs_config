# .emacs.d

From init.el:

```
;; An Emacs configuration inspired by the features of emacs-live by
;; Sam Aaron.  A configuration for Clojure, Terraform, bash, and more.
;;
;; My goal here is to create a leaner configuration than emacs-live -
;; one that has similar useful minor modes and configuration for Clojure
;; but starts more quickly and allows me to use the latest cider (&
;; family).
```

## Install

* Remove any existing `~/.emacs.d`
* Clone this repo: `cd; git clone git@github.com:joelittlejohn/.emacs.d.git`
